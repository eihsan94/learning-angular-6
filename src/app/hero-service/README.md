# the thing that we did in this branch
* we make a hero service that retrieve heroes data

* we used observable

# new things that we learn
## @injectable decorator
* This marks the class as one that participates in the dependency injection system. 

* HeroService class is going to provide an injectable service, and it can also have its  own injected dependencies. 

## what is provider?
make the HeroService available to the dependency injection system before Angular can inject it into the HeroesComponent
